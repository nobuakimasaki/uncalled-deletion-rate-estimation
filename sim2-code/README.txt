This directory stores the files used to simulate the data and apply the model in the second simulation study. 

deletions_sim_all_MAF_analysis.R is the file used to analyze the results of applying the model to the simulated data.

deletion_sim_functions_all_MAF.R and deletion_lik_functions.R contain functions used to simulate observed trio genotypes and calculate the likelihood respectively.

deletions_sim_data_all_MAF.R is the file used to generate the observed trio genotypes.  

deletions_sim_run_model_all_MAF.R is the file used to fit the model to the observed trio genotypes.
