sim_obs_trio_cnts_all_MAF.rds, sim_predel_parental_cnts_all_MAF.rds, and sim_true_trio_cnts_all_MAF.rds represent the simulated observed trio genotype counts for all MAFs, the simulated pre-deletion parental genotype counts for all MAFs, and the simulated true trio genotype counts for all MAFs.

The files est.res.13.*.all_MAF.sim.rds represent the result of applying the model to the simulated observed true genotypes and their bootstrap samples. 

The files resamp.trios.13.1.all_MAF.sim.rds represent which trio ids were resampled for each iteration of the bootstrap.
