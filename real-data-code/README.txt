get_missing.R is the R code used to count the number of trio genotypes in the real data.

deletion_lik_functions.R contains the functions used to calculate the likelihood when fitting the model.

deletion_real_data.R is the file used to get point estimates from observed trio genotypes in each MAF interval. 

deletion_real_data_boot.R is the file used to get the estimates from bootstrapped observed trio genotypes in each MAF interval. 

deletion_real_data_averages.R is the file used to obtain averaged statistics such as the overall genotype error rate and uncalled deletion rate for a set of MAF intervals. deletion_real_data_averages_boot.R is the file used to obtain this for the bootstrapped samples.

Finally, real_data_analysis.R is the file used to analyze the results of applying the model to the real data.
